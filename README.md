# Diabetes-Prediction System
A simple and interactive Machine Learning–powered Diabetes Prediction Web App built using Streamlit.

Users can enter basic health parameters, and the model predicts the probability of diabetes along with clear health range interpretations.

# 🚀 Features

🎯 Diabetes risk prediction using ML

📊 Beautiful UI with custom cards and color-themed components

📈 Displays probability score (not just Yes/No)

🧪 Shows normal ranges, interpretations, and health category info

⚡ Real-time prediction using trained ML model

💻 Built fully in Python + Streamlit

# 🧠 Tech Stack
