# Diabetes-Prediction System
A simple and interactive Machine Learning–powered Diabetes Prediction Web App built using Streamlit.

Users can enter basic health parameters, and the model predicts the probability of diabetes along with clear health range interpretations.

# 📜 About

This project is designed using an ML model trained on health parameters related to diabetes.
It serves as a quick-use tool for learning ML deployment, building Streamlit UI, and creating real-world health prediction systems.

# 🚀 Features

🎯 Diabetes risk prediction using ML

📊 Beautiful UI with custom cards and color-themed components

📈 Displays probability score (not just Yes/No)

🧪 Shows normal ranges, interpretations, and health category info

⚡ Real-time prediction using trained ML model

💻 Built fully in Python + Streamlit
